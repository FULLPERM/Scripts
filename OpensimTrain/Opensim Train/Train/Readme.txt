 This script works under DREAMGRID! It lives in the root prim of the engine, which in my test case was a box prim of size <9.00000, 1.20000, 0.75029>. The image below shows this moves out from its usual position

The track I used was some mesh track I found elsewhere, all named  "Guide". The reason I've been using it is that as mesh it was easy to just change the size and direction  of it when building track.  I'm glad this works BETWEEN regions, but you have to be driving it  to make anything happen. Ultimately I want to have a "guided tour" vehicle  running under the same principles but with a much expanded route across several regions. The old guided tour scripts were OK but couldn't go outside a single region.
